In face of the avalanche of data related to the incident, it would be necessary to use the best in class methods to efficiently decipher the data and detect the links in such time-sensitive analysis. For this purpose, a R-Shiny app is developed for interactive visualisation of the communication amongst GASTech employees across email and other online mediums. The network visualisation is presented in 3 parts: (i) email communication network, (ii) network of Credit Card Spending Locations; and (iii) Microblog Network Visualisation.\r\nThrough the employment network visualisation, the study is able to gain meaningful insights into the communication and activities of GASTech employees in the days leading up to the said disappearance of GASTech employees and their subsequent rescue by the police.\r\n2. MOTIVATION\r\nUsing interactive R-Studio interactive network visualisation packages, this study aims to showcase the use of network visualization to organise the information from various mediums such as emails, social media tweets, micro-blog and credit card transaction data into interactive and user-friendly formats for easy deciphering of the data that can enable the user to trace the links to the missing employees. The study also attempts to provide a more software-reliant approach based on R-tools for network detection and visualisation compared to the mostly Excel and Visio studio-based processes used in the VAST2014 Challenge on the same subject.\r\n3. DESIGN FRAMEWORK\r\nThe application is a R-Shiny app designed for interactive network visualisation of the activities of GASTech employees and local communities related to the disappearance of some GASTech employees. The network visualisation is presented in 3 parts:\r\nEmail communication network of GASTech employees;\r\nNetwork of Credit Card Spending Locations;\r\nMicroblog Network Visualisation.\r\nBy accessing communication in GASTech email and microblog text messages as well as tracing the transaction activities and locations of key individuals, the user would be able to detect meaningful patterns and important insights to assist with uncovering the causes leading to the disappearance of the GASTech employees.\r\n4.

This year three mini challenges are based on the previous 2014 challenges about a serious of events taking place in the fictitious country of Kronos. As the exact events and outcomes are known, our Team aims to analyse and evaluate the various methods used to uncover the events. We will also conclude based on whether the best methods will be equally successful without the advantage of hindsight. R and R Shiny will be used for this report.\r\n2.0 Motivation&Objective\r\nMany data analytical approaches and methods exists to solve real world problems in the areas of social networks, geospatial tracking and text analysis. While many methods can lead to the key findings, some techniques can uncover more depth and insights. We hope to showcase visualisation techniques that would be useful to uncover the important insights to solve/address the mini-challenges.\r\nObjectives: To provide insightful data visualisation that address and solve the mini-challenges.\r\n3.0 Overall approach\r\nDashboard will have tabs for each task. Options will be given to the users to allow them to layer the techniques in order to uncover the results. A comparison with the actual events may be given as an evaluation to the techniques.\r\n4.0 Approach for individual Challenge 1\r\n4.1 Mini Challenge 1\r\nGraphs will be created to plot similar news articles against timeline to show the order of similar documents in each important cluster as well as the relationships between primary and secondary sources through their common affiliations if any.\r\nGraphs will be created to plot the clusters of new articles against their bias scores.\r\nA dashboard with 2 tiers to visualize the formal relationships and shared goals in the 1st tier and the informal relationships and shared goals in the 2nd tier for GASTech, POK, APA and government\r\n Figure1: relationship between Location and Message to show the location where most messages originate form. Graph was created using JMP Pro and will be recreated in R for the Shiny dashboard.\r\n4.2 Mini Challenge 2\r\nUse the ‘timestamp’ and ‘location’ field of cc_data.csv and loyalty_data.csv to infer the most popular locations(scatter plot ) as well as the daily routine(Polyline in Tableau). Then based on the common sense ,we can detect the anomalies of activities: such as it’s not likely the large transactions can happen at the coffee shop.\r\nVehicle data adds the info of employee, which can serve as the context of each transaction or location info, and can help us calibrate our suspect of the anomalies\r\nTransactions are supposed to have more or less correlations with the identity of owners.\r\nBased on the above tasks completed, we can further sketch the relationship of employees through analysing the location and timestamp info.\r\nUsing some state of art techniques—social network analysis or graph theory.\r\n Figure2: Location over datetime. Graph was created using JMP Pro and will be recreated in R for the Shiny dashboard.\r\n Figure3: Map of Abila. Further key locations will included in R Shiny dashboard\r\n4.3 Mini Challenge 3\r\nHow does differentiating meaningful messages improves the identification of key events?\r\nUsing a Task1 method to classify meaningful event reports and use the events extracted to form a timeline representing the events. Dashboard with options to select events and show the occurrences of the extracted report over time using a time series spark graph. Include the reference to key events in the timeseries to see the correlation with the word count of key terms.\r\nIncorporate Task2 into the timeline allowing users to toggle between the different risk levels. Figure4: Sentiment analysis and Word Cloud. R Shiny dashboard to allow for selection of sentiment and associate words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
